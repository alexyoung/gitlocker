h3. Introduction

This is a Sinatra application that stores versions of things in Git repositories.  It's intended to be used to store versions of database fields:

* The repository is intended to be mapped to users of your applications
* The repository holds database fields
* A restful interface provides access to versions
* The repository can be deleted if the user leaves the service

h3. Configuration

Create a <code>config.yml</code> file in the same location as this README that specifies the location for the repositories:

<pre>
path:
  tmp/
</pre>

h3. Client Library

I've written a client library that includes a Rails ActiveRecord plugin here:
