h3. Introduction

This is a Sinatra application that stores versions of things in Git repositories.  It's intended to be used to store versions of database fields:

* The app has a HTTP-based interface
* Each repository is mapped to a high-level categorisation (I use users, so each user has their own repo)
* Each repository holds database fields.  If you checked out a copy, you'd see things like <code>1_field_name</code> where 1 maps to a database table ID
* The repository can be deleted if the user leaves the service

h3. Configuration

Create a <code>config.yml</code> file in the same location as this README that specifies the location for the repositories:

<pre>
path:
  tmp/
</pre>

h3. Client Library

I've written a client library that includes a Rails ActiveRecord plugin here:
