h3. Introduction

This is a Sinatra application that provides restful git.  It's intended to be used to store versions of database fields, but you could do anything with it.

Here's how I'm using it:

* I have several web apps that need versioning for user-generated content
* Each repository is mapped to a user in my client applications 
* Each repository holds database fields for models.  If you checked out a copy, you'd see things like <code>1_field_name</code> where 1 maps to a database table ID
* Users can switch back to any version of a document
* The repository is deleted if the user leaves the service

h3. Configuration

Create a <code>config.yml</code> file in the same location as this README that specifies the location for the repositories:

<pre>
path:
  tmp/
</pre>

h3. Client Library

I've written a client library that includes a Rails ActiveRecord plugin here:
